# Roles for the Rust-AKL Meetup Organisers

_The Rust-AKL Meetup is a community project and it requires the community to keep it going._

This document describes the roles for the Rust-AKL Meetup Organisers.  Please modify it as you
see fit. The purpose is to be able to easily recruit volunteers, they can read whats required 
for the role and autonomously complete it.

The prerequisits for a meetup is the venue and having at least one presenter.

### Facility Coordinator

*Required Effort*: Approx 1 hour per meetup.

This person organises the facility for hosting the meetup.  They will liaise with the facility to
book a room. With GridAKL this involves signing a contract once a year.  The facility should be 
confirmed before a meetup is advertised. They will need to get the instructions for entrance, 
audio-visual setup, evacuation procedure in case of emergency, and lock-up/closing.

### Facility Opener

*Required Effort*: Arrive 30 to 60 minutes before the meetup and be the last to leave.

This person arrives early to ensure the facility is ready, chairs are in place, and signs are out.
This person will also ensure latecomers can get in.  This person will also tidy up the facility at
the end and return it to the same standard as before the meetup.  They will also lock-up.

### Recruiter

*Required Effort*: 1 hour prior to meetup being announced.

There can be many recruiters, the idea is to convince some to present at the meetup.  Get a blurb
from the presentor and a little about them.  This can be put on the Meetup.com event page so
people know who is speaking and what the topic is about.

### Meetup Host

*Required Effort*: Arrive about 15 minutes early, host the meetup. Prep work in advance.

Someone to run the Meetup on the day.  This person will facilitate the meetup, the following will
need to be done, at a minimum:
 - Get people to quite down and take a seat.
 - Introduce the Rust AKL Meetup. 
 - Announce the Fire & Emergency drill.
 - Mention the sponsor
 - Food & Beverages koha
 - Introduce the speaker(s) and facilate any discussion.

### Food & Beverages Organiser

*Required Effort*: 60 minutes prior to meetup.

This person will organise food and beverages.  Food would be preferred over beverages.  There are
two ways to pay for this, one is via a sponsor and the other is donations from the audience.  If
you do receive a donation from the audience, this should be clearly mentioned by the Meetup Host
at the beginning and end of the night.  In general you will get about 50% of your money back.
This person should be ready to receive the food (if it's being delivered).
